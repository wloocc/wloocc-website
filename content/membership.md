Want in on climbing workshops, fun events, and exclusive perks 👀? For just **$5** for the term, you can become a member[^1] of the UW Climbing Climb for all of these and more!

Previous member benefits have included:
- Free candy at themed meetups
- Discounted comp registration prices
- Technique workshops and classes
- Lights-out headlamp climbing at PAC
- Free club stickers

We're run by volunteers, so all proceeds go directly to things that make climbing fun for you (the members)!
